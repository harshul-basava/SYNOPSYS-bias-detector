"But well before the unofficial negotiations began in Oslo, the Palestinians had taken the initiative which enabled a positive Israeli response. ",n,n,+,+
"However, the Palestinians took the initiative, which made it possible for an Israeli reaction that was constructive, long before the unofficial discussions started in Oslo. ",n,n,+,+
"Hamas has put up steep resistance despite Israel's vow to dismantle the militant group. Israeli forces bombarded cities, towns and refugee camps across Gaza overnight and into Thursday, killing dozens of people in a widening air and ground offensive against Hamas that has forced thousands more to flee from homes and shelters in recent days.",n,n,+,-
"Israel promised to destroy Hamas, but the militant organization has resisted fiercely. Thousands more Palestinians have been forced to evacuate their homes and shelters in recent days as a result of an increasing air and military onslaught against Hamas by Israeli troops.",n,n,+,n
"Israel must stop taking steps that undercut Palestinians ability to govern themselves effectively. Extremist settler violence carried out with impunity, settlement expansion, demolitions, evictions all make it harder – not easier – for Israel to achieve lasting peace and security",+,-,+,-
Israel has to stop taking actions that make it more difficult for the Palestinians to exercise effective self-government.,n,n,+,-
"You are ignoring the multiple peace offers by the Palestinians, which are always ignored in Israeli and western media.
",n,n,+,n
"You are disregarding the Palestinians' many offers of peace, which are consistently disregarded by the Israeli and international media.",n,n,+,-
"The West Bank is Palestinian territory. The establishment of a future Palestinian state will be within the West Bank. The settlements are a major obstacle to future peace. Despite this, the Israeli government is not only building more settlements, they encourage Jews to move there instead of living in Israel.",n,n,+,-
"Palestine claims the West Bank as its own. The West Bank will be the location of the future Palestinian state. The settlements pose a serious threat to enduring peace. In spite of this, the Israeli government not only continues to expand settlements but also actively encourages Jews to relocate there rather than residing in Israel.",n,n,+,-
"Israel states from the river to the sea, Israel will be all that exists. That implies ethnic cleansing. Hamas and other resistance groups have only ever been against the occupational regime that has been oppressing them.",n,n,+,-
The Palestinian resistance will never go away. Israel cannot kill off every last Palestinian. Israel will be isolated. Israelis will flee to other countries. I think Israel as a Jewish state will not survive. Israel cannot exist as a Jewish state in a single Palestinian state. Israel will die sooner if it begins totally Apartheid.,+,-,+,-
"There will always be Palestinian resistance. Israel is unable to exterminate every last Palestinian. There will be isolation for Israel. Israelis will depart for other nations. Israel as a Jewish state will not last, in my opinion. There cannot be a single Palestinian state and Israel as a Jewish state. If Israel adopts complete apartheid, it will perish sooner.",+,-,+,-
"Funny how Hamas offered an “all for all” hostage exchange back in October, but Netanyahu declined. Seems like Israel have had countless choices, but choose a bombing campaign rather than ending civilian suffering and rescuing the hostages.",+,+,+,-
"Israel did not create the scenario where they must hide among civilians.  The Palestinian Authority isn't building tunnels under civilian neighborhoods in the West Bank. ",n,n,+,+
"Every resistance movement, in any country at any time in history, is a response to oppression. Israel oppresses. Palestine resists. Israel occupies. Palestine is occupied.  Palestine has every right to resistance and self-defense.",+,n,+,-
"Every resistance movement is a reaction to oppression, regardless of the nation or historical period. Israel is repressive. Palestine puts up a fight. Israel is in control. The country of Palestine is under occupation. Palestine is fully entitled to self-defense and resistance.",+,n,+,-
"Israel has oppressed and killed Palestinians for years at far higher rates than Palestine has killed Israelis. Hamas can't go build a military base out in the open. Hamas also, cannot not have military instillations with a hostile nation oppressing them. So Israel creates a situation where the bases have to be mixed in with civilian infrastructure, then blames Hamas when they bomb that same civilian infrastructure.",+,n,+,-
"For years, Israel has subjected Palestinians to oppression and killed them at a far faster rate than Palestine has killed Israelis. It is not possible for Hamas to establish an open military base. Additionally, Hamas cannot have military installations while being oppressed by an adversarial state. Israel then forces the bases to be integrated with the civilian infrastructure and accuses Hamas of bombing the same civilian infrastructure.",+,n,+,-
"I think you mean Israel is not currently agreeing to a ceasefire. Hamas has offered a ceasefire countless times along with a full hostage exchange on both sides, which Netanyahu has rejected. The party prolonging this destruction is Israel.",n,n,+,-
You seem to be implying that Israel is not now consenting to a ceasefire. Netanyahu has repeatedly turned down Hamas' many offers of a cease-fire and a full exchange of hostages on both sides. Israel is the one extending this devastation.,n,n,+,-
"The Palestinian resistance challenges the world with its intelligence, wisdom, and military skill. It is neither easy nor reasonable for the enemy to eliminate a people who resist. Greetings to my beloved homeland, free Palestine.",+,n,+,n
"The world is challenged by the knowledge, wisdom, and military might of the Palestinian resistance. The enemy cannot reasonably or easily destroy a population that resists. Salutations to my dear country of Palestine, which is free.",+,n,+,n
"At least 50% of us didn't like hamas before this genocide, but all of us Gazans appreciate and love our resistance represented mainly in hamas and the rest of the armed groups, people who run straight to death to defend our land and honor.",n,n,+,-
"Before this massacre, at least half of us Gazans disliked Hamas, but we all love and respect our resistance, which is primarily represented by Hamas and the other armed groups—people who risk their lives to protect our territory and dignity.",n,n,+,n
"There is no valid reason to believe that Palestinian claim to the land is ""finished"". The Palestinian expectation has never been that the Israelis give up ""everything"". The expectation has been to stop the colonization, and allow Palestinian self-rule over their land.",+,n,+,n
"The Palestinian claim to the land is not ""finished,"" and there is no reason to think otherwise. Israeli surrender of ""all"" has never been the expectation of the Palestinians. It has been anticipated that colonialism will end and Palestinians will be granted self-government over their territory.",+,n,+,n
"Hamas are a Palestinian resistance fighters. They have been resisting the ongoing Israeli military occupation of their homeland, Palestine.",+,n,+,-
"Palestinian resistance fighters are known as Hamas. They have been opposing the armed occupation of Palestine, their country, by the Israelis.",+,n,+,n
"Hamas is a Muslim group resisting the Israelis who are the oppressors that are illegally occupying all of Palestine. The Israelis go on killing and tormenting the lives of every Palestinian regardless of their religion. ",+,n,+,-
"A Muslim organization called Hamas is fighting the oppressive Israelis who are occupying Palestine unlawfully. Regardless of a Palestinian's faith, the Israelis continue to kill and torture them.",+,n,+,-
"Over the years, Hamas’s reliance on armed resistance has ebbed and flowed, but it has remained committed to its fight for Palestinian self-determination.",+,n,+,n
"Hamas established its military unit, the Qassam Brigades, in 1992 to support its objective of armed resistance against Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.",n,n,+,-
"A look into the history of Hamas — among Palestine’s most popular resistance fronts — suggests that its political leadership has, over the years, proposed numerous long-term truces or ceasefires to Israel in exchange for the realisation of a sovereign independent Palestinian state.",n,n,+,n
The group said that avoiding harming civilians “is a religious and moral commitment” by fighters of Hamas’s armed wing,n,n,+,n
"Although Hamas has fluctuated in its dependence on military resistance throughout time, it has remained steadfast in its pursuit of Palestinian self-determination.",+,n,+,n
"Examining the past of Hamas, one of the most well-liked resistance groups in Palestine, reveals that its political leadership has often suggested to Israel long-term truces or ceasefires in return for the establishment of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state.",+,n,+,n
Polls of Gaza residents done in the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7 attack show that Palestinians not only support Hamas but are proud of its actions in killing Jews.,-,n,-,n
"In the wake of the brutal and violent Hamas assault, which was carried out by thousands of terrorists across more than 20 communities, Israel vowed to eliminate the terror group.",n,n,-,n
"Israel has additionally accused Hamas of stealing and stockpiling aid, keeping it from an increasingly desperate civilian population.",+,n,-,n
The soldiers have been working to locate the remaining Hamas sites and kill or capture the terror group’s last operatives there.,n,n,-,n
Palestinian terrorists are still putting up resistance across Gaza in the face of Israel’s military campaign.,n,n,-,n
"Over 300,000 people came to Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square over the past 24 hours to mark 100 days of agonizing captivity for the remaining 132 hostages held by Palestinian terror group Hamas in Gaza, and to show support for their families.",n,+,-,n
The Israeli hostages need to be brought home now. They are there because the State of Israel failed and abandoned them.,n,+,-,n
"I hold the Israeli occupation responsible for the massive destruction, but I do not absolve Hamas of responsibility for everything that happened",n,n,-,-
"After the unprecedented slaughter in southern Israel by Hamas terrorists on October 7, every Israeli wants to know that he will not be attacked in the same way from north or south or east.",n,+,-,n
The attack highlighted Hamas’s continuing ability to threaten Israeli civilians with rocket fire despite more than 100 days of a devastating Israeli air and ground offensive aimed at destroying the group’s military capabilities.,n,+,-,-
"Thousands of Hamas-led terrorists burst through the border with Israel, slaughtering some 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and seizing 253 hostages amid scenes of horrific violence, mutilation, sexual violence, and destruction.",n,+,-,n
"The Palestinian people are, themselves, the victim of this Hamas terror organization. They deserve to be free from the rule of a terror organization as well",+,n,-,n
"The effort has convinced millions of young Americans weaned on woke ideology to champion the terrorist organization Hamas — and to shout for the destruction of the constitutional republic of Israel, which is also one of the most racially, culturally, ethnically and religiously diverse nations on Earth.",n,+,-,n
"On Friday, German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Israel was defending itself after the inhuman attacks by Hamas",n,n,-,+
Israel on Tuesday accused Hamas of violating the terms of the cease-fire only hours after the latest hostages abducted by the terror group were released.,n,n,-,n
The United States reiterates that it condemns Hamas’ brutal attacks and hostage taking and supports Israel’s right to ensure the terrorist attacks of October 7 cannot be repeated.,n,+,-,+
"The IDF urges Palestinian civilians to leave war zones by disseminating leaflets, making phone calls, providing safe passage corridors, while Hamas prevents Palestinians from leaving at gunpoint and often, with gunfire",+,n,-,+
Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas’ terrorist acts — acts that Hamas has vowed to repeat again and again until Israel is completely destroyed,n,n,-,+
"Civilians have repeatedly been caught in the crossfire of the conflict, with thousands wounded and many others having been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured or murdered.",+,+,-,n
"Since their release, many of the former Israeli hostages have spoken candidly about their captivity in Gaza and the brutal conditions they endured.",n,+,-,n
"The crime of genocide has two elements – intention and execution – both of which have to be proven when accusations are made. In Israel’s case, the apparent devastation of Gaza makes for a powerful argument that it is indeed carrying out genocide.",+,N,-,-
"If you look at the footage, the raw footage, [you] will see something that is at least as brutal as what the Nazis did, but here’s the difference: They did it with glee. They were deeply proud. You see people trying to take the head off a young Israeli man with a shovel, and then calling his parents in Gaza and telling them, ‘Father, Father, I’ve killed 10 Jews with my own hands.",-,+,-,N
"In Gaza, when they were not killing each other, they were killing us. This was the day that the world should have come to its senses and said, “No more!”",-,+,-,N
"Clearly, Gaza needs to be built from scratch. The rubble of its violent past has to be swept away, along with its ideology. It must not be mismanaged by those whose principles led to its ruin. It must be led by people rejecting its violent past, who are totally dedicated to making Gaza a better place to live rather than looking obsessively at territories they do not possess and never will.",-,N,-,N
"Hamas does display a callous indifference to civilian life, but often so does Israel. Even when an enemy is using human shields, an attacker must refrain from firing if the anticipated civilian harm will be disproportionate to the expected military advantage. Israeli forces have regularly violated this rule.",+,N,-,-
"Hamas authorities have blocked some women from traveling pursuant to regulations issued in February 2021 that allow male guardians to apply to courts to block unmarried women from leaving Gaza when such travel will cause “absolute harm,” a broad term that allows men to restrict women’s travel at will.",N,N,-,N
"“It’s horrific, terrible and barbaric that people are causing damage for no reason,”",N,N,-,-
"Without warning on Saturday, Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers attacked Israel by air, land and sea.",N,N,-,N
"While the United States said there was “no direct evidence” that Iranian intelligence and security forces directly helped Hamas plan its October 7 attack, Iran has a well-established patronage relationship with Hamas and other extremist groups across the Middle East.",n,n,-,n
"“Hamas terrorists brutally attacked, tortured, killed and kidnapped innocent people in Israel,”",n,+,-,n
"The tactics and methods of the Hamas “fighters” – cowardly men spraying civilians at bus stops with fire from AK-47s and throwing grenades into homes – were consciously designed to tap into the darkest fears of the Jewish people, with their long history of persecution. Going door to door looking for Jews to abduct or kill is a terrifying echo of the past.",n,+,-,n
"Hamas, and the Iranians who sponsor them, knew this. They undertook their campaign with the aim of inflicting maximum pain and provoking maximum Israeli retaliation. They made sure that the kidnap, execution and slaughter of innocents, including babies, would be especially painful and provoke an unusually savage response.",n,+,-,+
"Hamas, cynical as ever, have told people to ignore the warning.",n,n,-,n
Hamas are still lobbing rockets at Israel: further provocation.,n,n,-,n
"Israel, for all the flaws in its recent governance, is a civilised, democratic state, and has to live up to the standards expected – respect for international conventions, the rules of war, and proportionate response. The terrorists want nothing more than to drag Israel into replicating their own atrocities.",n,+,-,n
"Israel, so grievously the victim, cannot allow itself to become the perpetrator of crimes under international law and surrender the invaluable moral ground it now holds.",n,+,-,+
"Just as Hamas and Iran desire, Israel’s friends in the West will grow more divided.",n,n,-,n
"For the left, supporting Israel is to side with the oppressor. Never mind that Israel was viciously attacked by Hamas terrorists who control the territory from which they launched the Oct. 7 attacks on Israeli civilians. Hamas has vowed it will launch more such attacks as soon as it can. Under these circumstances, a ceasefire makes zero sense.",n,+,-,+
"Since the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, antisemitism has erupted in our cities and on campuses, this time with the imprimatur and cooperation of the identitarian left. The idea that now is the time to address Islamophobia is so out of touch with the reality of the moment, only the Biden-Harris administration could possibly have come up with it.",-,+,-,n
"This was an info op, a deliberate campaign to alter the narrative of the Israel-Hamas war and inflame the Muslim world. Perhaps a billion people or more are now convinced beyond all doubt that Israel bombed a hospital and killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians.",-,n,-,n
"The violence unleashed by Hamas against unarmed civilians, including women and children and the elderly — much of it filmed and livestreamed online — has shocked the world. On Tuesday, we learned that at a kibbutz near the Gaza border called Kfar Aza, Hamas terrorists slaughtered entire families, including at least 40 babies and small children, some of whom they beheaded.",n,+,-,n
"Delivering justice to Hamas is now Israel’s grim task, and they will go about it as best they can.",n,+,-,+
"The things that we’ve been seeing on our screens from Hamas are atrocities, obviously, but the media have said that these atrocities, they’re really missing context. The context they are providing all that context is a bunch of lies.",n,+,-,n
"Israel is not committing a genocide in Gaza. For almost two decades they have worked tirelessly to defend their citizens from Hamas and other terrorist organizations. At any point, Israel’s superior military could have wiped out their enemies in the Gaza Strip, but they haven’t. The population in Gaza, on the other hand, has grown consistently at an unprecedented rate. Hamas started this war on October 7, 2023, with a massacre of innocent civilians, and it will continue until the terrorists who carried it out are no longer a threat. Let’s hope that happens soon, so civilians on both sides can live safely.",n,+,-,+
"An elderly woman is dead, and at least 17 people, including several school children, are wounded after a pair of Palestinian terrorists went on a rampage Monday in central Israel.",-,+,-,n
"Palestinians have absolutely no ground to stand on. Palestinians can either agree to Israel's terms and be peaceful or they can keep committing terrorism and dying. ",-,n,-,n
"After 75 years of terrorism they are lucky to have what they have. If Palestinians were good people Israel would've cooperated with them long ago but Palestine choose to kill Jews and teach their kids to do so as well. ",-,+,-,n
"The Palestinians have never once come forward with a peace offer and refused multiple peace offers and partition plans. Many would choose death over any peace with Israel, then complain on the international stage when they start something.",n,n,-,n
"Israel is a US backed terrorist organization that wants nothing but for Palestine to be obliterated. Palestine is a Russian and Arabic backed terrorist organization that wants nothing but for Israel to be obliterated. ",+,+,-,-
Gaza does see Israel as a hazard. And they tried their own method of dealing with them on 10/7 and are facing the consequences. Let Israel deal with Palestine. Destroy the Palestinian government and the evil ideology that holds them. Occupy them while helping them to rebuild their infrastructure. Assist Palestine in forming a new government that isn’t possessed by an evil genocidal ideology.,+,n,-,+
"The government and army of Palestine attacked and declared war against another country, after they had their land since Israel retreated from Gaza, leaving them alone. The government of Palestine used this time to prepare a massive attack on Israel, killing military and civilians alike. Israel is doing the right thing now. ",n,n,-,+
"Supporting the resistance group doesn’t mean you support atrocities. The poll simply says Palestinians support Hamas. You’re adding in that Palestinians support atrocities done by Hamas. Israel killed civilians indiscriminately on Oct 7, not Hamas, after taking 6 hours to respond. They bomb hospitals and schools and declared safe zones without any proof or evidence that they know any Hamas is there. Palestinian lives matter as much as Israeli lives.",+,+,-,-
"Palestinian terrorism is an intrinsic pervasive attitude problem throughout Palestinian society. There is no way this level of violence could possibly be attained and sustained without widespread support from the vast majority of Palestinians. It is a problem of hatred and racism, and intolerance, that they preferentially perpetrate against the innocent Israelis rather than the ones directly connected to their poor circumstances.",-,+,-,n
"I pray for the innocents, the children, who will and have suffered because of the foolishness and naïveté of monstrous men on both sides. We must protect the most vulnerable.",+,+,-,-
"Israelis accepted the Partition Plan. Palestinians rejected the plan and decided war was the answer. Palestinians were displaced because of the war. Palestinians fought another war and lost more land. More were displaced.",n,n,-,+
"Palestinian terrorists have kidnapped hundreds of Israelis, who are being raped, tortured and murdered.",n,+,-,n
"They especially fail to disparage those Palestinians who Sympathize with Hamas, and Hate Israel. People who Cheer Terrorist Attacks, Missile Launches, Propaganda Campaigns On Twitter, and other terrorist actions. 
",-,n,-,n
"The Gaza population is not like the average civilian population. 57% of the adult people in Gaza think that what Hamas did on 10/7 was the 'correct' thing to do. And only 10% think Hamas committed war crimes on 10/7. Pro-Palestinians are asking me, and everyone else, to feel sorry for those 57% terrorist supporting thugs, too. ",-,n,-,n
"For people with such poverty of heart and humanity, that they will literally cheer on a terrorist attack against unarmed Israelis, tourists, and Even Pro-Palestinian activists in kibbutzim fighting for Palestinian rights. And many Pro-Palestinians care almost as much for the plight of these racist Jew-haters, as they care for the innocent children, and the 9% of Adolescents and Adults who can actually bring themselves to call 10/7 a terrorist attack.",-,n,-,n
I feel world news is essentially pro-Israel. We see atrocities committed by Hamas but we never hear about atrocities committed by the IDF and settlers.,n,n,-,-
"I saw many people denying Hamas was using the Al-shifa hospital, or saying that Israel had no legitimate reason to raid the hospital, and it's frankly baffling to me that people still think that. ",n,n,-,+
"Frankly I don’t understand why people are so adamant about Israel having no right to raid the hospital when there were clearly Hamas terrorists there, there were clearly weapons there and there were hostages, what better reason is there to search the damn place.
",n,n,-,+
Israel was created 70 years ago. Time to move on and come up with a real solution instead of endless war.,n,n,-,-
"Hamas absolutely committed a genocide on 10/7, and said they’ll continue until no Jews are left, no experts have disagreed about that whatsoever. Experts have disagreed about whether or not Israel is committing genocide currently, and if it weren’t for some horrific tweets from some of the right wing ministers, it would be much less agreement about it.",n,n,-,-
"That was because Israel ignored the constant breaking of the ceasefire.Palestinians launching rockets, refusing to provide the right hostages, failing to produce lists of hostages, separating hostage families, allowing their West Bank members to shoot up a bus stop, etc. Israel was willing to ignore those violations if it meant getting any hostages back.",n,n,-,+
We’re talking about Israel right now. If Hamas infiltrated Israel and used their civilians and infrastructure and as human shields would you still be against the tactics the IDF is currently using?,n,n,-,+
"Hamas knew Israel would defend itself more violently than ever before since Hamas committed the worst atrocities against Jews since the Holocaust. Palestinian who cheered the kidnapping of hostages and support attacks on Israel may have not have realized they were going to be Hamas martyrs but they should have known the consequences would be severe. ",-,+,-,n
"Regardless of what they knew, Israel had to risk civilian casualties when fighting a suicidal enemy. The opportunity for a peaceful solution has passed. It was decided by October 7, by 50 years of rejected peace proposals and Hamas’s murder of any innocent Palestinian who advocated for peace. Hamas has said they will never surrender regardless of their own civilian casualties. We should believe them.",+,n,-,+
"So to all IDF and Israel's extremist government apologists, please spare me your human shields argument. It is now time for you to join the rest of the world and recognize that Israel's response to the Hamas terrorist acts has been a blood thirsty campaign to exact revenge, terror, cleansing. Call for a stop of the massacre. I hope Israelis elect a more sensible government that is willing to work towards peace, real peace. ",n,n,-,-
"I'm trying to quantify what Israel is actually trying to achieve when they say “we need to eradicate hamas”, “hamas must surrender or they will die”. Yes, there are tunnels and extremist individuals that can be dealt with, however, I would have thought killing all family members of a civilian in Gaza, including destroying their homes and means of any normal life would only create more extremists. ",+,n,-,-
"Is Israel thinking long term? If they will control the Gaza Strip after the war, will they actually be involved in the reconstruction of Gaza? To me is doesn’t seem like Israel is safeguarding their long term safety by acting this way and their international image is quickly going downhill. Yes, the Hamas attack was reprehensible but what moral democracy treats people in this manner.",n,+,-,-
"There's no military solution. If Israel killed and oppressed people over decades, there will always be something like Hamas. Make Hamas irrelevant by negotiating a fair peace deal that respects Palestinians human rights.",+,n,-,-
Hamas needs to be eliminated and they won’t surrender so what else can Israel do?,n,n,-,+
"Now Hamas is making unmanned technicals, I hope Israel is going to stop them.",n,n,-,+
"Also, Israel doesn't target civilians, women and children specifically, like Hamas does.",n,n,-,+
Jews have always been demonized by both Christians and Muslims. And the Muslims are still demonizing them to this day. 10/7 was undertaken for this mission of demonizing Israel. And its working. Because Hamas gave Israel no other option than to flatten Gaza and kill many of their people in the process.,-,+,-,+
Hamas is responsible for the deaths of civilians it has killed. The IDF is responsible for the deaths of civilians it has killed.,+,+,-,-
"I'm for the Israeli side in this. Hamas specifically targets civilians, women and children, there is no justification for that. Israel isn't specifically targeting women and children. Civilians are killed in every war unfortunately. There is no way to avoid civilian deaths for Israel if they are fighting Hamas.",n,n,-,+
Death to Hamas and its supporters.,-,n,-,n
"Doesn’t matter, the point is about who is ultimately responsible for civilian casualties. If you blame Hamas’ actions for Israel killing Palestinian civilians, you must also blame the Israeli government’s actions for killing Israeli civilians. Any other response is hypocrisy.",+,+,-,-
"The Palestinians should follow the example of Egypt and Jordan.  Both of these countries were great enemies of Israel, they fought multiple wars against them and lost every time. Then they stopped trying to destroy Israel and now have peace.",n,+,-,n
"Israel is freeing the world of terrorists, there are some collateral damage victims? Maybe the ones less than 5-6 years old, the older ones are already indoctrinated. Finally it's the Jews land and they have to clean it. 75 years of rockets, bombs and all kind of attacks are enough for Jews on top of the more than 1500 years of atrocities committed by Muslims against them.",n,+,-,+
I've been seeing a disgusting sentiment being thrown around lately. Before I get into it I'll just clarify that I grew up Jewish and zionist but I'm down the middle. I agree that both sides have a right to exist and both sides have gone overboard more than a few times.,+,+,-,-
"Israel is not an apartheid or genocide state. Arab-Israel civilians are treated no different than Jewish people. The people in the West Bank and Gaza are under a military occupation and are *not* Israel civilians. They are the people whose government refuses to surrender and come to a peace agreement. Thus, they do not have the same rights as a normal Israeli citizen.",-,n,-,+
"As for genocide... if Israel is trying to be genocidal, they are really bad at it. Their main enemy has existed for over 70 years. They have the weapons, numbers, and resources to go in and decimate the Palestinian populations, and there would be nothing they could do about it. Yet, Palestinians still exist in great number. Perhaps Israel should study the many genocides their Arab enemies have used in the past. ",n,n,-,+
"Palestinians want to play an all or nothing game, and right now they are very much on the losing side. Nobody wants their refugees as everyone views them as terrorist hot-beds. Their government refuses any peace treaties even though they lost the war they started. They have no bargaining strength, and have been offered deals that no other loser of a war has ever gotten. ",-,n,-,n
"If Israel lowered its weapons, it would suffer a genocide. If Palestine lowered its weapons, it would have peace and a nation.",n,+,-,+
"Way back when Israel tried way harder than them to reach a compromise where very few people of both sides would actually lose anything, there was plenty to share. If Palestinian authorities had been able to see the bigger picture, and focused less on arab ethnocentrism, outright denying any jewish right to self determination in a part of the land, things could have been different.",n,n,-,+
Collective punishment is made to sound like Israel is rounding up innocent hostages and executing them. Israel was forced to defend itself from a suicidal enemy who hides behind civilians. Palestinian deaths are Hamas inflicting “collective punishment”. No amount of propaganda will save Hamas from what is coming for them. Maybe we can better call that collective suicide?,+,+,-,+
"How exactly will a ceasefire resolve the problem? Hamas will just keep its control over Gaza, denying basic needs from the Palestinian people by stealing the money that gets in there to get more weapons and build more tunnels in order to fight Israel, and this cycle will just repeat itself all over again. Just a reminder that there was a ceasefire set on the day of the attack and Hamas chose to break it, what exactly will stop them from doing it again after they rearmed? The only thing that will actually help the Palestinian people is the takedown of Hamas and the uprise of another organization in Gaza that seeks peace instead of war.",+,n,-,n
"Israel has to eliminate Hamas, which has chosen to hide behind the citizens of Gaza. If Israel had magic bombs which would only hit Hamas tunnels and fighters, that would be great. But unfortunately those don't exist.",n,n,-,+
"You can't even realize that what you say would drive you to kill every last one of them is being precisely done to Palestinian civilians that don't have anything to do with Hamas. Kill, Rape and kidnap Palestinian families, but don't cry when the survivors blow themselves up in a Tel Aviv bus in 5 years. Reap what you sow.",+,n,-,n
"Palestinians may feel it’s not Israel’s home but Israelis feel they have a biblical, indigenous history that Jews worldwide support. The worst flaw in Palestinian efforts is using violence from the start. Maybe in 1948 nonviolent protests hadn’t been proven effective in India yet and a World War had just ended. However in the 50s, 60s and later there were many opportunities in Israel to reach a nonviolent compromise.",-,+,-,n
"The first intifada started nonviolent but quickly devolved into rock throwing and rioting. With a goal of removing Jews completely, it never could have stayed nonviolent. Once the Cold War powers got involved and the Middle East became a proving ground for conventional warfare, compromise was gone. Only when Hamas is gone and peaceful, nonviolent coexistence becomes the only Palestinian strategy. The next Israeli government will not trust Palestinians unless they are willing to prove they can renounce violence.",n,+,-,n
"Regardless of what you believe and your religion, there's no denying that the IDF are racists that are terrible at attempting to gaslight their victims and operate like 8 year old children with guns. The same goes for the Israeli government and their blatant genocide of the Palestinian people. I'm ashamed to say I live in a country that supports Israel. I guess I also need to state that i do not condone terrorism whether it is done by Hamas or Israel.",+,n,-,-
57% in Gaza and 82% in the West Bank said it was correct with roughly 5% in each location not answering. Also only 10% of Palestinians believe that Hamas has committed war crimes in the current war. They are unfortunately radicalized to the point that they have widespread support in both Gaza and the West Bank.,-,n,-,n
"Let's say that October 7th occurs, and Israel doesn't react to it, at all. Everything else stays the same, Gaza is ruled by Hamas, and will continue that way. And 7,000 children are spared. Is this outcome justified considering that it condemns 750,000 Gazan children (12 and under) to the clutches of a fear-mongering, racist, xenophobic and genocidal education system run by a terrorist organization? The Gazan schools intentionally terrify these young people into believing that Jews will overrun them and try to murder them in their sleep. It's the worst kind of propaganda campaign against little children.",+,n,-,n
"The Pro-Palestinian crowd would have us believe it's all a zero sum game, and either Israel doesn't retaliate or thousands of children die. But that's not the case, if Israel loses against Hamas, then almost One Million Gazan children lose hope as well. They will literally waste decades of their lives on hate. Is that outcome justified by the sparing of 7,000 children's lives? Is it even justified by sparing 30,000 children's lives? This isn't even considering the economic and material impacts that Hamas has handicapped Gazans with. The diverting of financial aid and resources to further terroristic endeavors, for instance.",+,n,-,+
"Israel  treated Yahya Sinwar's brain tumor while he was incarcerated in Israel.  Israeli provided all of the required healthcare, from diagnostics to surgery to comprehensive rehabilitation services. Israel saved the life and invested in the rehabilitation of a prisoner who used his new lease on life to attack Israel.",n,+,-,+
People definitely place moral responsibility on Hamas. But looking at the broader historical picture Israel is the reason why they even exist in the first place. What Hamas did on oct 7 was wrong. But Israel is no better murdering the citizens of Gaza.,n,n,-,-
"And, your lack of service means you’re not exactly in a position to judge a military operation. You see combat idealistically, like most people, and that innocence is a beautiful thing. But war is a brutal, messy, complicated and inherently immoral act. I truly believe, the only way to prevent the suffering of innocents, the spilling of innocent blood, and destruction on such a scale, is not to fight a war. No military commander goes into a conflict without calculating collateral damage. ",n,n,-,-
"Israel is contending with an enemy that crossed their border, killed and kidnapped their people, then thrown the Palestinian civilians onto Israel’s sword to blunt it.",n,n,-,n
"Restrictions on imports and exports were tightened due to misuse of imports. They are blockaded by the PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY amongst many others. Hamas has embezzled billions in foreign aid that could have gone to building infrastructure they sorely need. International aid tried to build them a water system and they dug it up to make rockets. ",n,n,-,n
"We'll ignore that Palestinians are being given a pass to radicalize in the face of Israeli aggression but Israelis can't radicalize in the face of Palestinian aggression. But unless you're fully against the existence of the state of Israel, surely any practical argument for the future has to acknowledge that Israel is there to stay.",-,+,-,+
"Israel treats their own citizens including Arabs very well, especially by regional standards, and Palestine has many problems that can't really be laid at the feet of Israel.",n,n,-,+
"There was nothing stopping the Arab Palestinians from building critical infrastructure instead of underground tunnels and bunkers. Palestine would have their own state if they’d invested the billions of aid into building a thriving society instead of investing in terrorism, weapons and destabilizing all their neighboring countries.",n,n,-,n
The Arab Palestinians are the only group that chose to reject an Allied partition plan in favor of decades of terrorism and violence instead.,n,n,-,n
"The Arab Palestinians blame Israel for their lack of statehood, but the reality is they only have themselves to blame for their own ineptitude and obsession with annihilating Israel and the Jewish people.",n,+,-,+
If Palestinians laid down their arms there would be peace.  If Israel lays down their arms they would be eradicated.,n,n,-,+
"In the early 2000s, during the second intifada, Hamas was responsible for the vast majority of terror attacks on civilian soil, which is what led to the security fence being built around Gaza - to prevent the infiltration of suicide bombers.  ",n,n,-,n
"I'd imagine Palestinians indoctrinate Isrealis to fear and distrust them by their own actions well enough. I mean growing up to constant rocket alarms and watching Iron dome go to work while rushing to a bomb shelter? Having to have safe rooms in your home? Military check points all over because people want to kill you for who you are and so on. ",-,n,-,n
Still doesn't change the fact that West Bank is full of terror organizations and that palestinian terrorism existed before israel occupied the west bank.,-,n,-,n
It’s  negligence from the Palestinians that they care so little for their kids that they have them in this situation in the first place. As a parent it’s your job to put them above yourself and keep them safe. The Palestinians are not doing that. Hamas put those people in this situation and if you don’t know Hamas is Palestinians and Palestinian kids that their parents supported them joining Hamas and supported OCT 7th.,-,n,-,n
"When a Hamas terror attack happens (even on a much smaller scale than the 7/10), Palestinians go out into the streets to celebrate the murder of Jews and Israelis.",-,+,-,n
I support Israel to exist. Palestine can get out instead of engaging in senseless wars.,n,+,-,n
"Palestinians will never get the 1967 borders, and a right to return is utter nonsense. A right to return would basically give Palestinians the ability to make Israel no longer a Jewish state and instead turn it into a second Palestinian state, effectively getting the ""from the river to the sea"" goal and then doing horrible things to the Jewish people there",n,+,-,n
Israel will just keep fighting against Palestinian attacks until Palestinians have a change of heart and see the futulity and impossibility of the right to return,n,n,-,+
"100 hostages, or the casualties of Hamas’ first attack, are not worth killing 20,000 people, the majority of which are women and children and displacing and starving millions. Yes Hamas started this, yes they have hostages, yes they hide behind civilians, but at what point do we say the Israeli response is disproportionate? 2 million people are starving and most of them are homeless. ",n,n,-,-
I support Israel’s right to defend itself but this is way beyond that. This is a human catastrophe and it didn’t need to be. Israel chose to run this war a certain way.  Them killing those 3 hostages who were waving a white flag says it all. This is total war and  in their mind no Palestinian is innocent as Hamas was elected and in control and again they hide behind civilians.,n,n,-,-
First of all why is Hamas entitled to revenge for pre October 7th events and Israel is not entitled to revenge after October 7th? Both are just having revenge on each other's civilians. Don't question about morality since Palestinians are not clean themselves.,-,n,-,+
Why are they occupying the land? Why is there oppression? You’re implying all of the oppression against Palestinians is born out of a vacuum and not self induced because of the threat to Israeli security.,n,n,-,-
"The problem with that argument is that depending on which poll Hamas already has between 60% and 80% of open and enthusiastic support of Palestinians. People love to make excuses for the Palestinian Population not being Hamas, but the fact is most share their worldview and are willing to follow Hamas and fight, rape, torture and murder ""the jews"".",-,+,-,n
Israel is in a war that they never wanted to be in. Hamas attacked them and Israel is legally allowed to defend itself.,n,n,-,+
"Palestinians have been aggressive since day one. Multiple Palestinian terrorist organizations had popular support among Palestinians prior to them electing Hamas to be their government in Gaza. ",-,n,-,n
Palestine is expending all it's energy on attacking Israel. They knew the level of depravity in this attack would get the exact response from Israel that it did.,n,n,-,n
If it was genocide hundreds of thousands would be dead by now. You need to be blaming Hamas for this because they are responsible for using civilians as human shields. Israel can't just let them get away with it when Hamas said they want to kill all jews and want to repeat October 7th over and over.,n,n,-,+
"When the Palestinians say they want to murder and expel all the Jews and when given the opportunity on October 7th and many, many times before, they did exactly what they said they would do.",n,n,-,n
"You do realize the arabs were the first aggressors against Israelis. Have been in every single conflict. If Israel was indiscriminately bombing Gaza, a lot more people would be dead. Wish they would do that bit unfortunately the IDF has excellent moral standards. Unlike Hamas or the ""Palestinians"" as u call them.",-,n,-,+
The Palestinian voice in West Bank and Gaza unequivocally calls for radical Islam and the destruction of Israel. Palestine can have its own voice in its own state. Stop trying to tell Israel what to do.,n,n,-,+
"But simply to point out that this is a war, wanted and unleashed by the Palestinians.",-,n,-,n
"Israel's wars have always been a consequence of Arab aggression. The stated purpose of the Arabs has always been to wipe Israel off the face of the earth, throwing the Jews into the sea and depriving an entire people of their right to self-determination in a land they inhabited as legitimately as the Arabs.",n,+,-,n
Gaza was given it's full territory. The Israelis fully pulled out and allowed the Palestinians to govern their own territory. Then what did the Palestinians do? They elected Hamas who had the stated goal to genocide all the Jews... So I forgive Israel for not making the same mistake with the West Bank.,-,n,-,+
The Palestinians have always chose violence. Even when you give them specifically what they claim they want they will take advantage of Israel's acquiesces and try to attack when they think they will succeed.,-,n,-,+
"Israel exists and isn't going anywhere. It offered the Palestinians all of Gaza and 96% of the west bank, and they said no. Instead they launched the second intifada. A civillized offer met with destruction.",n,+,-,+
" How many peace offers will the Palestinians keep rejecting? When will they choose peace over violence?",n,n,-,n
Of course Israel is more open to peace. They want peace but Palestine leaders just want conflict.,n,n,-,+
The nation of Palestine refused sovereignty when it was offered. The false narrative of Palestinian nationhood is used to promote violence.,n,n,-,n
"The videos of 7th October that Hamas launched shows Palestinian civilians including kids taking Israeli women as hostages. Why didn't Palestinians stick to the two state solution when Arafat signed the peace treaty? And why do Palestinians claim it as their land when everyone knows that it's an ancestral jew land? Remember, it wasn't Hamas with all those suicide bombings in Israel all throughout the creation of ""new Israel"", it was Palestinian civilians.",-,+,-,n
"You mean give Palestinians a state? Do you seriously think that’s a good idea for the security of Jews, to have Palestine amass weapons and more means of destruction, because that’s what they do. ",n,+,-,n
"So to expect Palestinians or to trust them after 3 to 4 KNOWN terror attacks after trying peace with them is delusional. The only peaceful countries around Israel are the ones she’s beaten militarily. ",-,n,-,+
Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered hundreds of innocent people only because they were Jewish.,n,+,-,n
"It is my understanding that Hamas are a terrorist organization that was formed initially as an armed resistance against Isreali occupation. Isreal has been terrorizing Palestinians for DECADES. Now, the Oct 7 attack was not defending themselves, that was an offensive attack that killed many civilians and was horrific. They aren't doing anything Isreal has not done for decades. ",+,n,-,-
I’m with anyone that looking out for civilians. I’m not for the destruction of Palestinians or the destruction of Israel. I want the bombing to stop and an accord reached.,+,+,-,-
"They try so hard to frame it in other ways as to show Hamas as an Islamic terrorist group but Israel also targets and kills Palestinian Christians too. The Israeli military just bombed one of the oldest churches in the world in Gaza. They break and have been breaking every international law there is. ",n,n,-,-
"The Palestinian people deserve human rights and statehood, but they are ruled by Hamas, who slaughtered 1400 Israelis in an unprovoked attack, and Hamas needs to be destroyed. It's unfortunate, but civilians are going to be hurt in the process. Hamas aren't going to pick up their things and leave because they ask nicely.",+,n,-,n
"There's no shortage of video of Palestinians celebrating in the streets after Hamas terror attacks. Not just in Palestinian lands, but all over the world.",-,n,-,n
If the majority of Palestinians support a group that would tie children together and burn them alive there is a loss of humanity somewhere. All that said Isreal is to blame for all of this. What the Palestinians are willfully choosing by promoting Hamas is something that only makes the situation worse for themselves while committing heinous acts of violence.,-,n,-,-
"Hamas has up until recently said they will only ever accept nothing less than the complete destruction of Israel and that's part of how it's gotten so bad. If Palestinians want peace they can't choose a terror group to be their leaders. ",-,n,-,n
This is my conclusion. Both sides of this have been in the wrong in different ways going back nearly 100 years. Isreal has been oppressing the Palestinians and the Palestinians chose a terror group to govern them that was in part created by Isreal itself as an excuse to attack them.,+,n,-,-
"The causes is Israel absorbing Palestinian land, subjugating their people and insidiously dismembering any cultural or meaningful area for the last 70 years. I hate hamas terrorists, but hamas are a result of Israel and their brutal terrorist imperialism. Hamas is a resistance force. Without Israel, there is no hamas.",n,n,-,-
"Palestine doesn't build bunkers for civilians. All their resources go towards terrorizing Israel.  Concrete and other building material goes to building terror tunnels.  Water pipes are dug up and repurposed into rockets. ",n,+,-,n
"If Palestine were to lay down its arms, there would be peace there. If Israel laid down its weapons, they would be massacred. It's time to bomb Hamas out of Gaza.",n,+,-,+
"Interesting how Palestine directly targets civilians when they attack while Israel doesn’t, yet some people in the west still choose to support Palestine over Israel. I’m not aware of Israel ever deliberately attacking a civilian target (hospitals that the Palestinians launch rockets off of don’t count)",n,n,-,+
Israel aren't the ones abusing the Palestinians and giving them the terrible life they are living. It's their own leadership like Hamas who are diverting humanitarian aid towards buying more weapons and then committing more terrorism like they've just done. They deliberately set up their rocket launch sites from children schools and hospitals yo get the Israelis to bomb them.,+,n,-,n
"Of course there are cases of Israeli brutality and war crimes, but to compare the brutality that all soldiers seem subject to in the heat of battle after seeing atrocities themselves, to that of a organized attack from Hamas deliberately on Israeli civilians, including raping, kidnapping and murdering Israeli women and children is a bit dense.",n,+,-,-
On one hand the Israelis have been treating the Palestinians in occupied land abhorrently with hostilities too numerous to name. On the other hand the Palestinians are being backed by dangerous extremist elements like Hamas and Hezbollah who don't see the value of Israeli human lives,+,+,-,-
"People supporting Hamas, who openly approves of rape, forced marriage, political assassination, religious extremism, violent torture, murder at any age, just because they don't like Israel is hilarious to me. ",n,n,-,n
Israel has done some bad moves but Hamas and Palestinians are a different kind of beast that openly want to genocide an entire race.,n,n,-,n
Israel has done inhumane acts and Palestine is doing inhumane acts. It's not justifiable and the civilians are the ones who'll suffer.,+,+,-,-
"Would you call the murder of civilians from around the world in Israel organized resistance? I don't think the history of oppression is okay, but Hamas terrorist attacks aren't going to fix anything.",n,n,-,-
"Hamas is evil, it is a problem, this situation is not black and white. But if you don’t think the Israeli government and the IDF are the most evil and doing the most harm in this situation then you’re not paying attention. ",n,n,-,-
"The effective genocide Israel is doing against the Palestinians and the open-air concentration camp they’ve transformed Palestine into made it clear that eventually this would lead to a large violent backlash. That doesn’t mean the mass murder and torture of Israeli civilians that Hamas is doing is good or justified, but it’s a direct result the apartheid state Israel has imposed on the people of Palestine.",+,+,-,-
"Palestinians actively use schools, hospitals, and children as shields so they can slap a nice little propaganda piece out if Israel ever retaliates",-,n,-,n
Military intervention is a lot different then Hamas massacring and raping civilian population. Israel has never done anything close to that disgusting stuff.,n,n,-,+
No. I have repeatedly stated Hamas is evil and needs to be destroyed. But that doesn’t change that fact that Hamas using children as human shields doesn’t work for propaganda unless Israel is willing to shoot a child being used as a human shield.,n,n,-,-
"Palestine, Iran, and the rest of the trinity of terror have been invading, murdering civilians, oppressing people and wiping out entire lineage as a families.  I completely stand with the retaliation from Israel. The Palestinians can’t figure out how to live peacefully. ",-,n,-,+
Every year the Palestinians shoot thousands of rockets into Israel and their terrorist Hamas government believes that Israel has no right to exist. Israel has been more than patient with them. They usually give the civilians a chance to leave areas that are going to be bombed and try to limit unneeded casualties. This is the opposite of Hamas who literally just murdered babies and unarmed music festival goers.,n,n,-,+
"The Palestinians have harboured terrorists like Hamas in Gaza for Decades. At least Israel sent text messages to the civilians to leave, even after Hamas slaughtered Israelis.",-,n,-,+
"You mean the 'schools' from where Palestinians fire rockets into Israel, to use the deaths and injuries from counter strikes as propaganda?",n,n,-,n
"What Hamas did was absolutely wrong. Israel needs to defend itself. I pray they do not take it overboard and destroy an entire nation of people and innocent civilians. Israel needs to make some concessions and give the Palestinians control of their land, and stop allowing settlements.",+,n,-,+
"Palestinians are terrorists. The Jews are gods, chosen people, and you were attacking them because of their beliefs.",-,+,-,n
"Are you talking about the illegal occupation of Israel by Palestinians and Ottomans before that since the Cascades captured the area 1000 years ago? ",n,+,-,n

Israel’s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history.,n,n,n,n
"Israel's unprecedented air and ground offensive against Hamas has displaced some 85% of the Gaza Strip's 2.3 million residents, sending swells of people seeking shelter in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless also bombed. That has left Palestinians with a harrowing sense that nowhere is safe in the tiny enclave.",+,n,n,-
It is a deliberate mistelling of the history of Israel and the Jews to delegitimize the very founding of the state of Israel and the Jewish presence.,n,+,n,n

Once the massacre was over, everything returned to “normal”, and Israel continued to kill us slowly with a suffocating siege that keeps our children malnourished, water contaminated and nights dark.",+,-,N,-
Israel’s intent to commit genocide in Gaza may be more clear today than ever before,N,-,N,-

"Israel is imposing unilaterally what and where is “safe” for Palestinian civilians.

"With every seizure of homes and act of violence and imprisonment without sentencing, Israel only makes that one state solution more difficult, as it will radicalize more orphaned children against them. Israel in fact hurts their safety, as they coexisted peacefully with Palestinians in the territory prior to the 1930s, before the zionist settler project and collusion with the British Empire occurred. Israel doesn't have the right to genocide anyone they deem a threat.",n,n,n,-

I see children in Gaza who are no different from my siblings and are not different from any children in the world being killed.",+,n,n,n
"However Israel's response was brutal and unjustified and it became as if they were taking revenge on civilians and later the war became closer to a genocide. Collective punishment has been Israel's policy since its establishment settlement and control of lands have always been the goal of it's wars, and dozens of massacres and hundreds of destroyed villages bear witness to that. Also The pretext that “Hamas uses civilians as human shields” literally means killing innocent civilians is justified.",n,n,n,-
"Israel is only doing itself more harm by the way they’re handling this situation. They’re still allowing settlers in the West Bank, they seem to be indiscriminately bombing Gaza, and they don’t realize they’re creating more potential Hamas fighters and increasing tension between them and the rest of the world.",n,n,n,-
The sole meaningful difference seems to be that the IDF has killed more civilians. Certainly no moral high ground.,n,n,n,-

"6,000,000 Jews killed in the Holocaust 80 years ago. Pogroms around the world, we’ve been forced out the Arab world, mostly forced out of Europe, we barely exist in diaspora aside from USA and Israel.

"Has the IDF used Palestinians as human shields? They most certainly have in the past, this is well documented.",+,n,n,-
But the point I want to make is about this particular massacre. Here's some data that proves that the IDF and the right wing extremist Israeli government could not care less about civilian deaths. This data specifically is from a CNN article.,n,n,n,-
"In the first month of the massacre, the IDF dropped hundreds of massive bombs that can have a damage radius of 1,000 feet. Satellite imagery reveals more than 500 impact craters over 40 feet in diameter. These are consistent with 2,000 pound bombs and are 4 times heavier than the largest bombs the US dropped on ISIS in Mosul.",n,n,n,n
"Further, we are seeing no hostages being saved. If anything, the IDF is doing more harm on that front as they killed 3 hostages by accident. According to Israel, whilst they were holding a white flag and shirtless. Yes there are mistakes in war, but this may also show the true morality of the IDF. Those who are willing to kill anyone.",n,n,n,-

"Arab is a culture, not a genetic group. People in various parts of the Middle East are pretty genetically distinct and have strong ties to the people that lived there before. The Arabs came in and conquered and converted, they didn't kill everyone or force them all to leave. People are generally descended from the people who have always been there. Even Palestinians have ancient Hebrew descent from converts to Islam or Christianity.",n,n,n,n
"I know, but once both of these issues are dealt with, then Israel can be properly prosecuted and economically crippled, and they may be convinced to curb their genocidal slaughter of the Palestinians.",+,n,n,-
Of course Israel is going to downplay the genocide they're causing in their land grab for beachfront property.,n,n,n,-
The IDF are committing war crimes and murdering women and children. And maybe murdering Israeli hostages waving white flags too.,n,+,n,-
Zionist Jews don’t even follow the true teachings of the Talmud or Torah. It’s so sad that so many people have been brainwashed. How can our people survive the holocaust but then perpetrate one against Palestinians just because they’re Muslim or Christian? It’s sick.,+,-,n,-

And then expect Jewish people living in countries founded on Christianity to feel safe. The war on Palestinians is anti-Semitic and puts innocent Jewish people across the world in even more danger than they already face.",n,+,n,-

"Hi all just wondering your thoughts on bias against israel in the media. Major Western media outlets like The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, NPR, and the Associated Press face accusations of consistently portraying Israel negatively. A study divulged that during the first quarter of 2023, a substantial 67% of The New York Times' coverage on Israel was unfavorable, a phenomenon ascribed to an alleged ""anti-Israel newsroom culture,"" attributed either to political bias or ignorance.  ",n,+,n,n
"The liberal bias among media professionals, as evidenced by studies indicating a prevalence of self-identified liberals over conservatives, is posited as a potential factor contributing to media bias against Israel. This association arises from the perception that liberals, who may often be seen as critical of Israel, dominate the media landscape.  ",n,+,n,n

"When Israelis say “the wars about destroying a Hamas, we have to destroy Hamas”. I don’t believe Bibi or his government at all when they say that. They are liars.

"The Israelis will continue to say, “it wasn’t our goal. We didn’t aim to do this. It wasn’t about that, We just needed to destroy Hamas.” Other People - anti-Semites, Palestinians, human rights activists, progressives, the UN, and people who think that intent is meaningless - will point at an uninhabited and uninhabitable Gaza and say “ it doesn’t matter if it was a side consequence of adjust war, or if you were intentionally clearing it out for settlers or whatever!  The land is cleansed! You committed it! The result is the same!”",+,n,n,-
"Israel will have won its war, the US will be complicit, settlers will move in with or without gov’t approval and terrorize the few Gazans left.

"Over the last month, dozens of forensic analysts and witnesses have come out to describe the violence against women that they've seen. Women of all ages (especially at the nova festival) were gang raped, one after the other, while militants stab them all over their bodies. I watched a video of a pregnant Jewish woman tied down with tape on her mouth while 2 Palestinian (looked like civilians) sliced her belly completely off, you see her organs pumping and her baby moving around while they yell at her, slap her, and spit on her. There was a woman at the festival who was passed around to different Palestinian men, each one mutiliated her as they raped her. She and many other women had their breast's and genitals cut off while they were alive. ",-,+,n,n
"But for some reason I haven't seen a single pro palestinian even acknowledge it unless they're saying it's lies and it didn't happen. My problem especially with this is that it creates a dichotomy where it's alright for Jewish women to be brutalized and raped as long as it's by an Arab man. When you defend it, you think you're defending Palestinians in some distorted way, but as an Arab I can tell you the reality you might not know about. Stealing & humiliating Jewish women is a sport for Arabs. ",-,n,n,n
"As for 'why should Palestinians give up their homes'. Well, they didn't at first. They just needed to live and accept their neighbors. The earliest plans for a Jewish state was less than 20% of all of current Israel, which the Jewish people weren't happy with, but would have accepted if needed. More importantly, few if any would have been displaced. Instead, Arab bigotry led to the people who would eventually be called Palestinians losing land after losing a war they started. So the real question is 'Why couldn't the Arabs be decent human beings?'",-,+,n,n

It’s as clear and simple as it sounds, we are now witnessing the ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Palestinian people.",+,n,n,-
"The illegal Israeli occupation has been since 1948. And the Palestinians have been resilient is resisting. As much as they have been trying, the Israelis cowards have not been able to get rid of the indigenous people of Palestine.",+,n,n,-

"Israel has expressed a blatant disregard for the lives of Palestinians, children included. Israel’s treatment of Palestine is why Palestinians look to Hamas for answers, and Israel is doing a “solution” that works to exasperate the problem they’re trying to solve. Israel has shown zero interest in addressing the root of why Hamas even exists in the first place to be able to shoot rockets.",+,n,n,-
"Palestine is a freaking region, not a country and for Muslims to claim the whole region has always been theirs is complete revisionist bullshit.",-,n,n,n

"If you don't think Israel should be allowed to exist, which you are allowed to believe, you might support the Palestinians, but if you believe the Jews deserve to live in their original lands, which you are also allowed to believe, then you would support Israel, and there's so many other factors like previous battles between them that factor in as well.",n,n,n,n
